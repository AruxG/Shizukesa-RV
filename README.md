# Shizukesa-RV
Shizukesa (静 け さ, "tranquility" or "inner peace" in Japanese) is a space with an oriental setting, more specifically Japanese, in which the user can immerse themselves to relax, release stress and perform tasks in order to obtain tranquility and peace.

It is a simulator that moves away from the immersive classics based on incessant action and that subject the player to unnecessary stress, thus providing a point of originality in this area.

In this environment, we are presented with different modules or workstation, in which we stop to carry out an activity that has traditionally been a relaxing stimulus, such as drawing kanjis, katakanas, hiraganas or whatever comes to mind, or feeding some lively fish in a pond.
